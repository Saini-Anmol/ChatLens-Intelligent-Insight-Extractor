Yesterday there was a news report that UWSA is no longer supporting its board MNDAA, TNLA, SSPP, etc.===================
The news is not Fake News, but the UWSA itself has called and interviewed in Pennsylvania.
===================
What... They said they were no longer providing weapons and financial support, so to speak, they had supported it in the past.
===================
Okay.... The MNDAA and TNLA have grown so much because of the support, because of the support, and how can they grow otherwise, there is no infrastructure like the 0.
===================
1027 During the invasion, his subjects got a lot of territory, and even the UWSA still took the territories that they were crazy to keep here and there
===================
What a joy it is to be part What is going to happen now, what is going to happen... The army has seized the Horn, and the line is on the Outer Plains-Lasho road, and the towns of Sindhi and Hobab are day and night.
===================
In the meantime, the MNDAA has not fired a single shot because it has been forced to turn the army back to the neighboring city of Clarence. UWSA also seems to be looking at China right next to him, and he has a show on the border with Thailand in between, and that's political
===================
economic, the economy is the main thing that is important for a province or a city to visit, the economy is the import and export of the country, the economy is the export of the country, the export of the UWSA is from China, the export of goods to China is through the mandatory. Maybe that's why the UWSA doesn't support the border bowls, because they can't get anything out because it's not cold, they don't have enough goods to export, they don't have enough goods to get around, not to mention Chinese, even in their region
======================================
So yes, at that meeting, we put the national flag in a row with the armed flags, and we didn't just provide weapons and money, we didn't provide the rest, we needed the rest of the supplies, we didn't need weapons and money where the rebels were going to live, we needed resources and provisions.
===================
Even some people who were walking around in those areas said that the UWSA were walking around in MNDAA uniforms... Now
===================
 if you really want peace and federalism, you can't just go around and support it, just keep on the screen and see what their current statement is."

The Revolution 
of 
 the Armed Rebels 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Yesterday in the capital city of Pansan, "Wa" Province, UWSA Deputy Leader 
Xi Kang An, and the Armed Forces
 of Shan Province
: Deputy Chief of the KNDAA Force, Li Long-pong,
 General Secretary Sun Ke-chang;
- Vice-Presidents of SSPP/SSA Shan Force, Swakunsai and Swakaithai 
- Deputy Commanders of the TNLA Plumbing Corps, Takulan and 
 Secretary Tarbon
, attended this meeting
 because the UWSA "W" Force is the one that provides 
these three armed groups from behind the scenes, including 
manpower, weapons, and financial resources, in Operation 1027 and other battles. 
Whenever there are clashes, the men 
of "W" are fighting in their respective armed rebel units
, changing into military uniforms.
 This is because,
 among the armed rebels, the only rebel groups that have 
their own weapons factories are the "0" and the KIA.
 It is
not easy to fight in the long term without weapons and ammunition.
 Financially and politically, the "0" brigade is
the most powerful of the rebel groups.
 
In
 the past few days, George N. Sibley, Chargé d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Myanmar, traveled to the
river and met with KIA leader Guan Moor to discuss the land issue and 
other issues.
NUG/PDF, China has called in the armed forces and other groups to
discuss providing weapons and military assistance, and posted on
social media.Just
 after this meeting, China put strong
pressure on "Wei" from behind and officially announced that it would no
longer provide military aid to such armed forces.
It also shows that China fully supports the Myanmar military
in order to defend its interests, and
 the Lara and Lara are different in the armed forces.
 Such a formal cessation
of military aid by "0" would also
greatly weaken the armed rebel groups.
 In order for the upcoming elections 
to be held peacefully, we need to be able to retake the territory.
The KIA
is not going to be able to fully produce the ammunition for the sake of it.
 The KIA itself is fighting in the territories, so 
it has the weapons/ammunition requirements.
 I see the 
only ones that will be suppressed in this scene are the PDF and the TNLA.
The coming political scene will come a 
period in which the fighting will intensify and
the rebel forces will be torn apart in order for 
the army to regain 
territory.

88 The difference between the NUG and the NCGUB that👇👇👇👇
Dr. Sean Wing is talking about: Let me tell you a little bit about the conclusion that the NUG and NCGUB will end up like Dr. Seinwin's far-flung
 coalition government, they will only exert diplomatic and international pressure, and the NLD members in the government will follow the principles of the NUG, and they will not carry out an armed revolution. 
They only seek help from the donors in order to stand up for the NCGUB. They don't lied to the people and don't donate to the people, they don't reach out to the country, they understand that they are passing through local forces, they don't interfere, they believe that domestic politics is not central, they 
travel internationally, they do everything they can to get involved in parliaments, they are criticized for not living in border indigenous areas, they have problems, but NCGUB is a student body.We treat all political organizations with respect and respect, so we don't lose our relationship with each other, even though our politics are different, and we are all polite, and
 the NUG we now form is a collection of liars, thieves, and crazy people, and we are motivated to send our families to war abroad, and the NUGs do not even go to
basic education, they threaten their education, they kill their teachers, they kill their priests.
There are the boys who have young wives, the
 girls who got pregnant because they bumped into the captain, the 
marijuana beer shop, the KTV room guard, the
 morally fouled lower class mobs, the 
guys who cheat and steal public sweat papers in all sorts of ways, the 
Dow Passage and the Mercury Railroad,
 the NLD Senators
.Take place in the NUG, take place in both the NUG and the CRPH. They have no principles, 
and they are shameless, but they are not ashamed to slap their descendants.
 
There is no
nagar, no dignity, no
ability
to lead a revolution, everyone who understands politics knows that the NUG revolution is over, there
 are only two roads: whether you
grow old and die abroad, or go back to the country, or you want
 to go back to the country, 
that's why I am saying that there is no end to it, like Dr. Saint Winn. Crime awaits them.

  <div class='text'> The NUG terrorist group has ordered that their subordinate slaves, the Pakhaf factions, must come to the aid of the TNLA, which is dying of dead dogs... 
It's like dying for the TNLA, so to speak... 
The TNLA was a group that treated the MDY-PDF and DPLA groups that fought alongside them with a slave attitude when they gained a small amount of territory... 
Sending a TNLA team that doesn't have enough ammunition to come to the rescue is like saying they're going to death... 
The NUG guys will never fight..?

#န
Vote for the USDP that may be in the early stages of the election There 
are people who come to us asking
which party to vote for
in the election, so today I
am writing which party
you should vote for and why: 
Elections are
important in a democracy, and it is also very important for the
people to be able to vote regularly
in elections. 
If you don't want to be
among the people who voted for the NLD
in the elections held in the past few 
years and have lifelong
regrets, I would like to urge you to
vote for the USDP
. 
Before I talk about
why I should vote, I would like to remind you that the country was bloodied
by the one vote you cast
in 2020. I want those who voted for the NLD
to learn from the backdrop and vote in
this election, and 
I want them to vote.
 
I would like to explain
two reasons why you should
vote for the USDP, and if you write it broadly, it could be as much as
a book. 
First, it has the credibility to delegate state power to
the USDP. 
 To
believe in an institution cannot be built in a
short period of time. You have to
know the historical
background and political origins and believe in it to vote. 
The USDP is not the party that
emerged yesterday, and the best
time in Myanmar's history is that the USDP
is in its 20s
. 
I'm now over 41
years old, so
I've been through the NSP government, the NLD government,
the government today
, and I've 
never had a better time
than the USDP government of the NSP.
 The 
U.S. and the international community
alike have been very gentle about the Spring Change
. At the time
, the bloody Arab Spring
was celebrated and compared
. 
Ray has the ability
to befriend
an indispensable enemy, as well as the ability to move the country smoothly through
velvet politics
, and 
this experience
is a good political
starting point for the USDP. The
people's socio-economic life developed under the USDP government. 
As an undeniable fact, the 1,500 cents who are consuming 
today have 
the evidence, and
the envious will blame the previous government for mixing with the previous government and devaluing
the debit
cards, but 
the obvious step
that the bold change during the USDP
government has changed the social life of
the people. What was developed
is still a testament to history to this day
. 
 
The voice of President Hun Sen's speech of respect for
the people is
still imprinted in the hearts and minds
of the people to this day, this 
is the symbol of the USDP, this
 is the image of the history of the USDP,
 so that the people
can
 govern with love and kindness in the hearts of the people.The party is also the only party
in the present moment, 
so to say that the USDP has
the full potential that the people believe
in, and 
secondly, because the USDP is
in harmony with the army, and 
our country is
not yet a liberal
democracy, a mature democracy. Nor
is the civil armed conflict as a one-night tale

Yeah... It's a KIA drone in Venmor,
 it's a weapon that looks directly through a drone camera and makes a visible attack on the enemy.
 It doesn't run into creeks, ditches, and building craters, and
 it looks like it's a whole bunch of rice from behind. 
They're demonstrating their capabilities with new weapons and systems, and
 they're becoming more effective and explosive than they have ever been.
 Look, there's nothing to discuss in the bloodshed.

  <div class='text'> At a time like this, only by voting for the USDP party, which is historically and
politically aligned with
the military, can civil-military relations
smooth and push the country in a positive
direction. 
We
need three forces: the government, the people:
the House of Representatives, and if there are partisan
representatives in
the House of Representatives who have asked for a stop
to the offensive, it will be
difficult to do. 
 There used to be. 
Just as a government needs to be in
harmony with the military, the military needs to
support it. Political
scientist Hamilton once said
, "In a democratic system, it is often said that
governments that are not supported by the people
fall, but
in reality governments that are not supported by the military are more likely to fall. 
 If you look at the current
situation in Myanmar and the situation
in Bangladesh, you need to learn 
from this and vote for the USDP
, not 
to mention
the other parties
at the moment, in 
the 2020 elections
, there were parties that were
involved in the interference of foreign powers. 
In one of Dr. Nate Lat's books
, I read
that Sojos
said he was responsible for bringing the NLD to power, and the U.S. Embassy
announced that it had provided $46 million
to the NLD government during the 2020 elections. 
I can't say that, but we have to
learn a lesson: we need to stop
voting for these parties, and 
one last thing I would like to say is
that we would like to
urge you to put your trust in the USDP
, which has the ability to move the velvet politics
smoothly according to the lessons
of history.

I
 want to laugh at the fact that the promoters 
sometimes
see the rebound of posts that have
been said in this way, and I 
see that there are only
 two things that they can do when it comes to 
politics, one 
is, as
Li Kuanyu said, the lowest level of politics, which is to arm
 the people.
The other is to attack the army with the tactic
that if you attack the army with
pig-headed tactics, it is political, and
 in this way you make the people
bleed, and they
run abroad with their heels and hips, which is the beginning of the politics of
the '88 generation.
He also doesn't seem to understand
the nature of direct transition and
transition in
Heltington's democracy: 
when the problems
of political conflict that arise are left unresolved, and when a domestic/foreign
war breaks
out, democracy comes to a pause. 
To name just two examples,
Zelenskyy, whose current president
is
out of office because of the war in Ukraine, is continuing to be president.
 This is a temporary pause in democracy, and 
the same is true in Myanmar, where the problem of voter fraud in the 2020 elections
 Democracy has been at a standstill for a period of time because of the unresolved NLD
, and
 now the political gurus
don't know
which country they are fleeing to, and 
the number of people
who died because of their actions is the fourth highest in the
world with 15,420 deaths
from August 2024 to August 2025.
 
I don't want to blame them
for running away because they don't want to take responsibility, but we need to stop the people
who are fueling the

-On August 20, no short-range rockets were fired in the 13th area, according to ground

India 
and the United States desperately wanted the Burmese Mineral Crisis, and KIA's new 
playground During World War II, the old Lido Road was being rebuilt by India, the BBC reported. Why is this abandoned road now alive in November 1945?
-
The road that was built at the suggestion of American General Steelwell is called the Steelwell Road. India is accelerating the Connected Highway project.
-
I think the fact that India wants strategic opportunities as much as the U.S. wants rare earths is one of the factors that have awakened this highway. 
-
Rare earth minerals are a popular mineral of the world's industrialized nations and one of the world's most respected minerals. Among the few countries that produce rare earths, the rare earth ore from the Panwa region in northern Myanmar is the Heavy Rear Earth, which is quite famous and valuable in the world. 
-
Not only modern intercontinental ballistic missiles, but also high-tech electronics, rare earth metals are indispensable in the world today, and Myanmar neighbor China accounts for a large percentage of the world's rare earth metals trading market. Rare earth minerals are 17 mineral elements that are difficult to produce and technically complex, so only a few countries have the potential to produce them.

Today, I wrote a female paddle: 
We see that MDY-PDFs are on the run and are depressed because of the high number of injuries, and that the families of the fleeing PDFs in this depression are exploding because they are pressuring and threatening to kill the families of the fleeing PDFs... 
I mean, like these guys say, PDFs are broken... 
Inevitably, the Army is taking back one city after another in great force, and it's quite technologically advanced... 
If you continue in the jungle without consciousness at this time, you are doomed to death... 
Simply put, the escaped PDFs were spared... 
Even today, the Army has taken back the Wax Mountain... I'm going to keep it all going forward... 
So if you run away, your family will still be threatened, and
if the light shines, you will have to stay with your family and have a job... 
You can choose the path you like... You're going to have to keep in touch with the little ones who are enlightened... Let's ask...//Wow

 Don't be afraid of anything, just think that your luck has
come back to you. The government and the army have forgiven you many times, and they have given you leniency, but
 this time in any way. 
There is no reason to forgive them in any way, for 
 in the eyes
of their own soldiers who are eager to plant the flag in Lysa, they are exploding with all their might, imagining the rape and massacre of the families of the police who had retreated from Muncie.BURMESE AND BUDDHISTS HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THAT A KACHIN FEMALE SINGER WENT UP TO THE PRAYER HILL IN HER SHOES AND INSULTED THE ENTIRE BURMA NATION.IF
 YOU FORGIVE SUCH A STUPID KIO KIA, THERE WOULD BE NO MORE
WRONG MISTAKE. 
It's like getting out of prison and releasing them over and over again.When you get out of prison, you're just going to do the usual crime again, and you can't be merciful
because of the dog-tailed bullets.When
 it comes to sovereignty, I just want to
urge you to turn the dice out of the American knot and turn it all over.

According to the statistics they have shown, it is stated that even if you own a cart, you will be taxed at 20 thousand rupees, and if you collect 100,000 per cattle, 300 per gallon of petrol and 50 per bamboo, it is not strange that the armed revolution is not suppressed.
